# Recipe Page â€” Frontend Mentor

## Description

This project is a solution for the [Frontend Mentor | Recipe page](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/recipe-page-KiTsR8QQKm) challenge.

The goal was to build a responsive recipe page closely matching the design. The project uses semantic HTML5, modern CSS (with oklch color variables), two custom fonts (Outfit, Young Serif), and BEM class naming. All sections (ingredients, instructions, nutrition) are visually and structurally separated.
